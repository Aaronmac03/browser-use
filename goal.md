i want to use browser-use on my pc. refer to browser-use docs and best practices as needed. We will start by using a single powerful model (Gemini 2.5 Pro), with the hybrid architecture being a long-term goal. include serper when it's helpful. the goals are low cost and high capability. speed not important within reason. i want it to be highly capable, able to grind its way through complex multi step jobs. it needs to use my chrome profile with my accounts. i don't want a list of allowed domains. I want to avoid coding too many specific instructions for specific sites or situations, and I want to lean on the intelligence of the models as much as possible.

This is for my personal use only.
