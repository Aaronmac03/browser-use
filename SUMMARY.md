# Project Summary and Setup Guide

This document summarizes the work done to create and configure the personal web agent. It also provides instructions on how to run the agent.

## 1. Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create a highly capable, personalized web agent that can automate complex, multi-step tasks using the `browser-use` library, the Gemini 2.5 Pro language model, and the user's existing Chrome profile.

## 2. Agent Architecture and Features

The agent has been architected as a multi-layered, intelligent system designed for complex task automation.

*   **Hierarchical Planning:** The system uses a two-tiered agent structure:
    *   A **Manager Agent** acts as a "thinker," decomposing high-level user goals into a series of concrete, actionable sub-tasks.
    *   A **Worker Agent** acts as a "doer," executing each sub-task using the browser and other tools.
*   **Long-Term Memory:** The agent is equipped with a persistent long-term memory, powered by a local ChromaDB vector database. It stores the details of every task it performs, allowing it to learn from both its successes and failures.
*   **Self-Correction and Reflection:** After each task, the agent enters a "reflection" phase where it critically analyzes its own performance. These reflections are stored in its long-term memory, creating a continuous feedback loop for improvement.
*   **Language Model:** The agent's intelligence is powered by Google's **Gemini 2.5 Pro** model, accessed via Vertex AI.
*   **Personalized Browser Integration:** The agent uses the user's local Chrome browser and profile, giving it access to existing sessions, cookies, and extensions for a seamless experience.
*   **Advanced Tooling:** The agent is equipped with a suite of advanced tools, including:
    *   A **Serper API** integration for Google searches.
    *   A stateful `fill_form` tool for reliably navigating complex web forms.
    *   A loop detection mechanism to prevent it from getting stuck.

## 3. How to Run the Agent

There are two ways to run the agent: from the command line or via a clickable desktop application.

### 3.1. Command-Line (CLI) Method

This is the most direct way to run the agent.

1.  **Open your terminal.**
2.  **Navigate to the `browser-use` project directory.**
3.  **Run the following command:**

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate && python3 examples/personal_agent.py "Your task goes here"
    ```

    Replace `"Your task goes here"` with the prompt for the agent.

### 3.2. Desktop Shortcut Method

This method provides a user-friendly graphical interface for running the agent.

1.  **Open Automator:** You can find it in your `Applications` folder.
2.  **Create a New Application:**
    *   When Automator opens, select **Application** and click **Choose**.
3.  **Add "Ask for Text" Action:**
    *   In the search bar, type "Ask for Text" and drag it into the workflow area.
    *   In the "Question" box, you can type "What is the task for the agent?".
    *   Check the **"Require an answer"** box.
4.  **Add "Run Shell Script" Action:**
    *   In the search bar, type "Run Shell Script" and drag it below the "Ask for Text" action.
5.  **Configure the Shell Script:**
    *   Set the **"Pass input"** dropdown to **"as arguments"**.
    *   Paste the following code into the text box, replacing `/path/to/your/browser-use/project` with the actual, full path to your `browser-use` project directory:

    ```bash
    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
    cd /path/to/your/browser-use/project
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python3 examples/personal_agent.py "$1"
    ```

6.  **Save the Application:**
    *   Go to `File > Save`.
    *   Give your application a name, like "Personal Agent", and save it to your Desktop or Applications folder.

You can now double-click this application to run the agent.

## 4. Project Files

*   **`goal.md`**: The original vision document for the project.
*   **`examples/personal_agent.py`**: The core Python script for the agent.
*   **`.env`**: A file (which you created) that stores your secret API keys.
*   **`SUMMARY.md`**: This document.
